- Support multiple classes and methods.
- Script will generate one graph for each class. If there is more than one method, multiple disjunct graphs are drawn.

TODOs
[HIGH]
- Read each of the graphs and return test requirements (medium/low effort)
- Print graph connections on terminal (low effort)
- Get ID of method with parameters (low effort)

[MED/HIGH]
- For each is not supported (medium-high effort)
- Classes inside classes are not supported (medium-high effort)
- Functions inside methods are not supported (medium-high effort)
- Ternary operator is interpreted as a normal assignment (medium effort)

[MED]
- Empty lines are still mapped (low effort)
- Method signature is currently ignored, check if that's correct (?)
- Some parts of the logic will look for specific words or characters, and do not test if these are inside a string (low-effort)
- Try catch is not properly mapped (high effort)
- Functions as variables/objects are not supported (high effort)
- Logic will not test for all unbalanced objects, like parentheses (medium-high effort) (?)
- Review code manipulation in cleanup process: some methods might have to come before others (medium effort)
- Code might fail if there are open/close brackets in the same line (medium/low effort)
  -- Empty method

[LOW]
- Source code corresponding to each node is not drawn along with image (high effort)
- [refactoring] trimLines is called many times in the cleanup process (medium effort)
- [refactoring] functions that match brackets (medium effort)
- [refactoring] graphgen loop
